Apoth3osis Enterprise Commercial License 1.0 (CECL)

Effective Date: upon execution or first use for non‑qualifying entities

1. License Grant. Subject to payment and compliance, Licensor grants You a non‑exclusive, worldwide, non‑transferable license to use, copy, modify, and distribute the Software in object or source form for any lawful purpose.

2. Fees.
  2.1 Minimum. USD 25,000 per month, indexed annually on January 1 by CPI‑U (All items, U.S. city average, NSA, Series CUUR0000SA0).
  2.2 Usage Fees. Additional usage‑based fees may apply, determined by an independent auditor based on Your actual usage of the Software, with reasonable audit procedures (see Audit Procedure). True‑ups are invoiced quarterly.
  2.3 Taxes. Fees are exclusive of taxes.

3. Certification & Trademark Rights. While this license is in good standing, You may use the “Apoth3osis‑Certified” mark solely in accordance with the Apoth3osis‑Certified Trademark License and only for artifacts covered by a current attestation.

4. Attestation & Support. Licensor will provide an attestation bundle (e.g., SLSA provenance, SBOM, build metadata), and support/SLA per the Apoth3osis Attestation Service Terms.

5. Compliance & Audit.
  5.1 Records. Maintain accurate records relating to usage for at least three (3) years.
  5.2 Audit. No more than annually, upon 15 business days’ notice, Licensor may engage an independent auditor under NDA to audit usage. Auditor’s report determines usage fees. Licensor bears audit cost unless underpayment exceeds 5%; in that case, You pay audit cost.
  5.3 True‑Up. Pay any underpayment within 30 days of invoice.

6. Term & Termination.
  6.1 Term. Month‑to‑month unless otherwise agreed.
  6.2 Termination for Cause. Either party may terminate for material breach uncured for 30 days after written notice.
  6.3 Effect. Upon termination, stop using “Apoth3osis‑Certified” marks, and cease use of attestations. Continued internal use of already delivered Software is allowed if all fees through termination are paid, unless breach involved unauthorized distribution or mark misuse.

7. Liquidated Damages for Unauthorized Commercial Use.
  If You (a) exceed license scope, (b) use “Apoth3osis‑Certified” marks without a current attestation, or (c) misrepresent SMB/Public Good status, then damages are difficult to quantify. As a reasonable estimate of harm, You will pay the greater of: (i) two (2) times the unpaid fees for the period of noncompliance, or (ii) Licensor’s actual demonstrable damages, plus reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, and any auditor’s fees where misrepresentation exceeded 5%. This is not a penalty but a fair pre‑estimate of harm.

8. Confidentiality. Attestation bundles and audit materials are confidential.

9. Warranties & Disclaimers. Except as stated in the Service Terms, the Software is provided “AS IS”.

10. Limitation of Liability. EXCEPT FOR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT, BREACH OF CONFIDENTIALITY, OR IP INFRINGEMENT, NEITHER PARTY IS LIABLE FOR INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. DIRECT DAMAGES ARE LIMITED TO 12 MONTHS OF FEES PAID.

11. Governing Law; Arbitration.
  11.1 Law. Michigan law governs, excluding conflict‑of‑laws rules.
  11.2 Arbitration. Any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement will be resolved by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules. Venue (including hearings) and seat: Oakland County, Michigan. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court with jurisdiction. Either party may seek equitable relief in court to protect IP or confidentiality.
  11.3 Fees. The prevailing party is entitled to reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.

12. Miscellaneous. Assignment only with consent (not unreasonably withheld) except in a merger/sale; notices in writing; entire agreement supersedes prior terms; severability; waiver must be explicit; force majeure.

By using the Software outside the Public Good or Small Business licenses, You accept these terms and agree to pay applicable fees.
